# Q&A Chatbot with OpenAI

This project is a Q&A chatbot built using OpenAI's language models. It leverages Streamlit for the web interface, Langchain for the language model handling, and dotenv for environment variable management. This README will guide you through the setup and provide an overview of the code.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Langchain_ChatBot.git
    cd Langchain_ChatBot
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\.venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash

      ```

4. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
    LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
    ```

6. **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage
- Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to see the app.
- Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar.
- Select the OpenAI language model you want to use.
- Adjust the temperature and max tokens settings as needed.
- Type a question in the text input field and get a response from the chatbot.

## Security

- **Never expose your API keys in your code.** Use environment variables to keep them secure.
- Add your `.env` file to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed:
